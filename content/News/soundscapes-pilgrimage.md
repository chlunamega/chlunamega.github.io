With the support of the Buckner W. Clay endowment for the humanities, I will begin a project on  sounds related to spiritual practice. The starting point will be Northern Spain, specifically the Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage that dates back to the Middle Ages. Incidental, spoken and architectural sound will be recorded in the course of two weeks on the path from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (France) to Le√≥n (Spain). The recordings will be used as sound models for a series of electroacoustic pieces. I will have the joy of collaborating with Virginia Luna, my wife, who will write prose and poetry reflecting on the recorded sound.
