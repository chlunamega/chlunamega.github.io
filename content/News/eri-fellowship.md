This is a collaboration with Stephanie Roe, environmental scientist focused on temperature and land use change impacts on tropical forests and CO2 concentrations. As 2019 fellows of the Environmental Resilience Institute of the University of Virginia, our project combines climate science with musical composition. Through earth system modeling, we will test how expanding forest cover based on biophysical and sociopolitical realities will impact climate (biogeochemical and biophysical processes) as well as ecosystems and the services they provide, at the global and regional scale. We will then translate the modeling outputs into music, thereby transforming ecological climatology data into a medium accessible to the general public. This inter-disciplinary collaboration seeks to connect the sciences with the arts, specifically environmental science with music, in order to expand the possibilities of cultural engagement with environmental change and sustainability.
