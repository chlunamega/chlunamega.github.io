The first installment of a multdisciplinary collaboration with environmental scientist, Stephanie Roe, musician / mathematician, Zach Baugher, and composer / programmer, Diego Villase√±or, will be presented at Pro Re Nata Brewery, in Crozet, VA. In "Forestcover", the musical material of the viola, cello, piano, and electronics, is derived from data predictive models exploring how forest cover based on biophysical and sociopolitical realities will impact climate as well as ecosystems and the services they provide, at the global and regional scale, from year 2000 to 2100. The main idea is to explore and compare two scenarios: 1. "Business as usual", in which we face a catastrophic climate change; 2. "A greener world", in which we are able to revert dramatic changes in albedo, temperature and land use, that would give us a chance to re-think the way in which we inhabit our planet. I am very pleased to perform with wonderful musicians Danielle Wiebe-Burke on viola and Schuyler Slack on cello.
