I am very pleased to announce my second album release, now with the Other Minds Records label. The album collects five previously unavailable pieces that explore the variety of methods that I have been developing throughout the years to create music from environmental sound and information. The album features these high caliber performers and improvisers: Kelly Sulick and Diego Villase√±or, flute; Rachel Condry, clarinet; Christopher Luna-Mega, electronics, guitar, piano; Jakob Pek, electric guitar; Aaron Oppenheim, Jeanie Aprille Tang, and Maxwell Tfirn, electronics; Jennifer Wilsey, Nava Dunkelman, and Ian Antonio, percussion; Laura Berger and Ning Yu, piano.
