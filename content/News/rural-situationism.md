I am excited to be part of the Rural Situationism project and contribute this release. This album-length piece is a meditation on the rural land in the face of drought, noise polution, and urbanization. The sound sources are various recordings in the Sample Ranch, in the Central Velley, California. It is the fifth of seven extended duration pieces by seven sound artists fully immersed in the world's soundscape. Check out the other pieces by Francisco López, Andrew Weathers, Jon Mueller, Jim Nollman, Stephen Karnes, Kate Carr.
