Stay tuned for my next release with Full Spectrum records, a collaboration with seven sound artists fully immersed in the world's soundscape. My contribution is a set of recordings in the Sample Ranch, in the Central Velley, California. The piece is a mediation on the rural land in the face of drought, noise polution, and urbanization.
