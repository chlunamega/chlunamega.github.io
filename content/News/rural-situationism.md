This album-lenght piece is a meditation on the rural land in the face of drought, noise polution, and urbanization. It is the fifth of seven reselases by seven sound artists fully immersed in the world's soundscape. My contribution is a set of recordings in the Sample Ranch, in the Central Velley, California.
