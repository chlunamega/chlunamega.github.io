Welcome to a sonic immersion in the science of fire and water. The evening features music for string quartet and electronics that is drawn from water and fire research from science departments in SJSU and UCSD. The wildfire-driven music is written by students of composition, electronic music, and theory & analysis at SJSU’s School of Music and Dance. Music students have analyzed data from SJSU's Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center (WIRC) as source material in order to compose pieces for string quartet and/or electronics. The water-driven music explores the otherworldly sounds of Arctic bearded seals and the multiplicity of rhythms and patterns of water, all cast into music for string quartet and electronics by Christopher Luna-Mega. All the music for string quartet is performed by the stellar Friction Quartet.
