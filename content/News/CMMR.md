Excited to present the electronic procedures and compositional decisions behind my piece "Geysir", for seven pianists, at the CMMR conference in Marseille, France in October 14-18, 2019. The paper 'Geysir, for seven pianists: pitch class predominance/amplitude analysis and musical translation of geological noise', was written in collaboration with my brilliant friend Jon Gomez. We will explain the programming used for the extraction of the most predominant pitches in a recording of one of the geysers in the Haukadalur valley, in Iceland. Some of the compositional procedures for the piece will be presented as well. The article will be included in the proceedings of the 2019 edition.
