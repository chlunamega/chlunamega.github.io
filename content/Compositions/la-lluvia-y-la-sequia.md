La Lluvia y la Sequía is a field recording sound collage with added instrumentals and sound processing. It explores the intrusion of the urban in the rural, rain, drought, and a week in the lives of a San Joaquín Valley ranch, in Central Valley, CA. The piece was a commission for the Rural Situationism project, in which seven composers—Francisco López, Andrew Weathers, Jon Mueller, Jim Nollman, Stephen Karnes, Kate Carr, and myself—participated in a seven-volume release. The concept of the release is that each of the pieces are site-specific, drawing heavily from notions and experiences of place.
