This piece is the result of an exploration of symmetry through various musical dimensions, mainly, motivically, harmonically, and formally. All the harmonies in the piece are results of pitch collections derived from purely symetrical explorations on the keyboard. The piece also presents an underlying narrative consisting of two distants points, or groups of sounds, gradually approaching each other. This idea is explored harmonically, mainly from the perspective of dissonance and consonance and their relationship to proximity.

Performer: Fernando Carmona, piano.
