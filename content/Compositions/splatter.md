This piece is a commission from Roscoe Mitchell for his orchestral cycle
"Conversations for Orchestra", premiered in Reykjavik, Iceland, in the 2016 Tectonics festival. "Splatter" is a transcription and orchestral arrangement of a free improvisation of the same title included in the album titled "Conversations I", released in 2014. The album features Roscoe Mitchell on saxophones, Kikanju Baku on drums and Craig Taborn on piano and electronics. For this piece I was particularly interested in Roscoe’s polyphonic/multiphonic playing in the bass saxophone and the rhythmic complexity of Kikanju’s relentless rhythmic saturation. The arduous transcription process compensated with invaluable insight about this group’s improvisational and overall musical vocabularies. The orchestration aims to display the characteristic energy flow and development in Roscoe Mitchell’s masterful formal conception of improvisation. In this version, Roscoe Mitchell is improvising as a soloist. The original version does not include a solo improviser. I thank Maxwell Tfirn for developing a Max MSP patch that helped to transcribe the harmonic resonances created by the electronics in the middle section of the piece.
