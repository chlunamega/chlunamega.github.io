The sounds of geological phenomena are generally noise. Wind, glaciers, oceans, streams, and other geological sounds present a vast content of frequencies that often obscures individual pitches or groups of pitches. However, noise varies from sound to sound with different pitch predominance and patterns. This variance contributes to the signature that makes several noise sounds unique. In this study, the sound  of one the geysers in the Geysir system of the Haukadalur valley, 180 miles Northeast of Reykjavik, Iceland, is recorded and analyzed in multiple time segments, each with its own pitch predominance and, therefore, signature. The analysis is further adapted into a piece for seven spatialized pianists and electronics of my authorship, Geysir, which features the amplitude and predominant pitch class fluctuations throughout the geyser sample.

In this study, 11 minutes of recording are analyzed using a suite of software for the identification of amplitude and frequency (pitch) content. The pitches are quantized –simplified– to equal temperament (C, C#, D, D#, etc.) in order to be adapted to the piano’s tuning affordances. 

The audios provided below are examples illustrating pitch sets derived from the pitch predominance analysis. See the full score for notation and transformations of these sets. 

Three aspects of the study are provided in pdf links: 1) amplitude contours of the geyser by octave; 2) full pitch predominance analysis code results; 3) score for seven pianists and electronics.

The paper on this study will be published in the Proceedings of the 2019 Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research conference in Marseille, France.
