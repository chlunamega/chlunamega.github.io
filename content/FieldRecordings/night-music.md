This is a fragment of a recording of a summer dusk insect chorus in Walnut Creek Park, Albemarle, Virginia. The recording uses five microphones in a pentagonal formation, at a distance of ~30 meters between each mic. The objective was to perceive as much of the sonic texture as possible, in order to recreate the recording with spatialized speakers.
