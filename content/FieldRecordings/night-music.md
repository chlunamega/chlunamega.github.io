This is one of the five channels of a spatialized recording that features summer dusk sounds in a Virginia deciduous forest. The recording was made with five simultaneous microphones spread out facing outwards in an imaginary pentagon of 180 ft./side. Each mic. is assigned to one of the five spatialized speakers in the installation or performance space.
The soundscape features a gradual saturation and de-saturation in the texture over the course of 73 minutes.
