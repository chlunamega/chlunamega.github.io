Its complex harmonies, dynamics and rhythms shift perpetually and in subtle ways. If listened to as a background, the sound may appear to be static. With a focused listening, musical shapes emerge from the sound mass. With the intention of musically assimilating into the sonic characteristics of the geyser, the score for seven pianists and electronics translates its harmonic, dynamic and rhythmic activity, from the lowest to highest register of the piano. Each pianist focuses on an octave and is projected through a speaker, which results in a diffused sound around the audience. The electronics present the geyser in its original form, divided into seven tracks, one track per octave, in order to be fused with the pianos and spatialized around the hall. </p>\n<p>Performers: Esther Kim, piano 1; Tim Booth, piano 2; Seung-Hye Kim, piano 3; Gabrielle Chen, piano 4; John Mayhood, piano 5; Nick Anderson, piano 6; Nancy Zhu, piano 7; Zhen Wang, electronics; Christopher Luna-Mega, electronics.</p>\n<p>Software development: Maxwell Tfirn and Jon Gomez.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Geysir\nsubtitle: for seven pianists\nduration: 9 min\nslug: geysir-composition\nmp3: geysir.mp3\nimage: geysir-pic.jpg\nimg_width: 400\npdf: geysir-score.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Geysir (for seven pianists)\nyear: 2016\ncreation_date: 2016-09-29\ninstrumentation: (seven pianists)\npremiere: October 20, 2016.

As I listened to these sounds, I became interested in the way in which their harmony, rhythm, density, dynamics and timbre relate to each other and how they evolve in time. In the process of translation from field recording to instrumental music there is a transformation that occurs due to notation, acoustics, and esthetics. My objective is to bring these sounds to music (are they music already?) as faithfully as possible, establishing a direct connection to their original form, imagining their transformation as transmigration (in sanscrit, Jatyantara-parinamah): the characteristic traits of a sound are detached from their source and born into a new form (the composition, the musician and the instrument), adding to it a new layer of existence and at the same time keeping the essence of its previous source.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Jatyantara-parinamah\nduration: 14min\nslug: jatyantara-parinamah\nmp3: jatyantara-parinamah.mp3_DESCRIPTION_Rachel Condry, clarinet; Joshua Marshall, tenor saxophone; Peter Sloan, trombone; Aprille Tang, electronics; Stephan Haluska, harp; Brian Baumbusch, acoustic guitar; Jacob Peck, electric guitar; Julie Moon, piano; Tim Black, percussion; Scott Siler, percussion; Tim Kim, violin 1; Dylan Neely, violin 2; Crystal Pascucci, cello 1; Kimberly Sutton, cello 2; Christopher Luna-Mega, conductor\nimage: jatyantara-manuscript.jpg\npdf: jatyantara-parinamah.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Jatyantara-parinamah\nyear: 2012-2013\ncreation_date: 2013-03-15\ninstrumentation: (cl, ten sax, tbn, 2 perc, elec guit, ac guit, harp, pno, 2 vl, 2 vc, electronics)\npremiere: March 7, 2013.

The album features Roscoe Mitchell on saxophones, Kikanju Baku on drums and Craig Taborn on piano and electronics. For this piece I was particularly interested in Roscoe’s polyphonic/multiphonic playing in the bass saxophone and the rhythmic complexity of Kikanju’s relentless rhythmic saturation. The arduous transcription process compensated with invaluable insight about this group’s improvisational and overall musical vocabularies. The orchestration aims to display the characteristic energy flow and development in Roscoe Mitchell’s masterful formal conception of improvisation. In this version, Roscoe Mitchell is improvising as a soloist. The original version does not include a solo improviser. I thank Maxwell Tfirn for developing a Max MSP patch that helped to transcribe the harmonic resonances created by the electronics in the middle section of the piece.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Splatter\nsubtitle: orchestral adaptation of a free improvisation by R.

Just as topography shows variations in altitude, the mind also fluctuates through different stages of activity in peaks and valleys. For this piece I took the visual content of a defined number of landscapes and translated it mainly to pitch, texture and density in the orchestral materials. The sections of this piece are based on a group of harmonic spectra that are used as foundations for other parameters in the piece. The creative process for this piece consisted on a thorough listening of the open fourth string of the double bass, its underlying harmonies (overtones), and their evolution in time.

Waves Break Aural Shores was written using various spectral analyses of the sound of the ocean in Puerto Marqués, in the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Each analysis utilizes a specific resolution, register and loudness threshold, which result in different music notations and instrumental techniques. This leads to the notion of different versions of reality (waves) through the multiplicity and variability of perception (aural shores). Underlying the technique and theory behind the piece, my attempt is to translate the breath and pulse of the breaking waves, to reach inside the heart of another vastness. </p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Waves Break Aural Shores \nsubtitle: portrait of Puerto Marqués\nduration: 10 min\nslug: waves-break-aural-shores\nmp3: waves.mp3_DESCRIPTION_New Thread Quartet\nimage: waves-pic.png\nimg_width: 400\npdf: waves-score.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Waves Break Aural Shores (portrait of Puerto Marqués)\nyear: 2018\ncreation_date: 2018-02-06\ninstrumentation: (saxophone quartet)\npremiere: February 2, 2018.
