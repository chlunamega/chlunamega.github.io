Its complex harmonies, dynamics and rhythms shift perpetually and in subtle ways. If listened to as a background, the sound may appear to be static. With a focused listening, musical shapes emerge from the sound mass. With the intention of musically assimilating into the sonic characteristics of the geyser, the score for seven pianists and electronics translates its harmonic, dynamic and rhythmic activity, from the lowest to highest register of the piano. Each pianist focuses on an octave and is projected through a speaker, which results in a diffused sound around the audience. The electronics present the geyser in its original form, divided into seven tracks, one track per octave, in order to be fused with the pianos and spatialized around the hall. </p>\n<p>Performers: Esther Kim, piano 1; Tim Booth, piano 2; Seung-Hye Kim, piano 3; Gabrielle Chen, piano 4; John Mayhood, piano 5; Nick Anderson, piano 6; Nancy Zhu, piano 7; Zhen Wang, electronics; Christopher Luna-Mega, electronics.</p>\n<p>Software development: Maxwell Tfirn and Jon Gomez.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Geysir\nsubtitle: for seven pianists and electronics\nduration: 8 min\nslug: geysir-composition\nmp3: geysir.mp3\nimage: geysir-pic.jpg\nimg_width: 400\npdf: Geysir-score.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Geysir (for seven pianists) $geysir-pitch-class-predominance-analysis.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Geysir's pitch-class predominance analysis\nyear: 2016\ncreation_date: 2016-09-29\ninstrumentation: (seven pianists)\npremiere: October 20, 2016.

In the process of translation from field recording to instrumental music there is a transformation that occurs due to notation, acoustics, and esthetics. My objective is to bring these sounds to music (are they music already?) as faithfully as possible, establishing a direct connection to their original form, imagining their transformation as transmigration (in sanscrit, Jatyantara-parinamah): the characteristic traits of a sound are detached from their source and born into a new form (the composition, the musician and the instrument), adding to it a new layer of existence and at the same time keeping the essence of its previous source.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Jatyantara-parinamah\nduration: 14min\nslug: jatyantara-parinamah\nmp3: jatyantara-parinamah.mp3_DESCRIPTION_Rachel Condry, clarinet; Joshua Marshall, tenor saxophone; Peter Sloan, trombone; Aprille Tang, electronics; Stephan Haluska, harp; Brian Baumbusch, acoustic guitar; Jacob Peck, electric guitar; Julie Moon, piano; Tim Black, percussion; Scott Siler, percussion; Tim Kim, violin 1; Dylan Neely, violin 2; Crystal Pascucci, cello 1; Kimberly Sutton, cello 2; Christopher Luna-Mega, conductor\nimage: Jatyantara-manuscript.jpg\nimg_width: 300\npdf: Jatyantara-Parinamah.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Jatyantara-Parinamah\nyear: 2012-2013\ncreation_date: 2013-03-15\ninstrumentation: (cl, ten sax, tbn, 2 perc, elec guit, ac guit, harp, pno, 2 vl, 2 vc, electronics)\npremiere: March 7, 2013.

Every movement in the piece is a fragment taken from the 40 minute original recording. The striking increase in density and loudness as dusk becomes night is the guiding formal principle of the piece. The recordings, featured in the electronics, were made with five simultaneous microphones in a pentagonal formation, at a distance of ~30 meters between each mic. Each of the five microphone analyses and transcriptions was assigned to an instrument (mic 1 to ob.; mic 2 to cl., etc.), rotating the pairings in each movement. The multi-channel recording sought an expanded listening field resulting from the different microphone responses and placings. Among the various features of the night sounds, one particularly caught my ears: constantly microtonally morphing triads and their aggregates resulting from the superimposition of the multitude of crickets.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Night music \nsubtitle: for Splinter Reeds (ob., cl., alto sax., bass cl., bn.)\nduration: 8 min 30 sec\nslug: night-music-composition\nmp3: night-music.mp3_DESCRIPTION_Splinter Reeds concert recording$ night-music-field-recording.mp3_DESCRIPTION_original summer dusk forest recording\nimage: night-music-pic.jpg\nimg_width: 400\npdf: night-music-score.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Night music (for Splinter Reeds)\nyear: 2019\ncreation_date: 2019-02-06\ninstrumentation: (ob., cl., alto sax, bass cl., bn.)\npremiere: February 1, 2019.

The album features Roscoe Mitchell on saxophones, Kikanju Baku on drums and Craig Taborn on piano and electronics. For this piece I was particularly interested in Roscoe’s polyphonic/multiphonic playing in the bass saxophone and the rhythmic complexity of Kikanju’s relentless rhythmic saturation. The arduous transcription process compensated with invaluable insight about this group’s improvisational and overall musical vocabularies. The orchestration aims to display the characteristic energy flow and development in Roscoe Mitchell’s masterful formal conception of improvisation. In this version, Roscoe Mitchell is improvising as a soloist. The original version does not include a solo improviser. I thank Maxwell Tfirn for developing a Max MSP patch that helped to transcribe the harmonic resonances created by the electronics in the middle section of the piece.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Splatter\nsubtitle: orchestral adaptation of a free improvisation by R.

Wake up! / Don’t waste a moment!”</p>\n<p>These words are often found engraved in the Han, a heavy solid board of wood hung by the front door of Zen meditation halls. A rhythm is beaten with a wooden mallet on the Han three times a day to signal times in the monasteries. The characteristic contracting rhythmic pattern (from longer to shorter values) references impermanence of life, while at the same time summons the monks to be mindful in their practice in order to transcend the cyclicality of life and death. </p>\n<p>The arrow of time presents the Buddhist contracting rhythmic, adding to it an expanding rhythmic pattern –from shorter to longer values. The resulting contraction/expansion leads to a cyclical 10-bar phrase that emphasizes the notion of eternal recurrence. Each of the performers repeats this phrase eight times in different tempi. At the end of the eighth repetition or section, all performers synchronize at section one and the cycle is repeated. This process can be continued for as long as the performers decide and the context of the performance allows.</p>\n<p>From the listener’s perspective, the material becomes clearer and more transparent as one is able to perceive the cycles of each instrument individually. As a result of the listener’s attention to each individual cycle, there is an increase in the perception of the various synchronicities that happen in different points of time between two or more instruments. These different simultaneous temporalities in which the cycles occur can be seen as a reflection of the challenges of our existence as individuals, community, humanity, and planet. Just as the listener attempts to integrate the different tempi and cycles of the instruments so can we see the dilemma of humanity to find harmony within the many different tempi of our world. Listening for the simultaneity within the diversity of The arrow of time may be experienced as the effort and commitment it takes to develop mindfulness and presence.

When I began thinking of material to write a piece for the JACK Quartet, I thought that the sounds of the bearded seals would be ideal material for strings – the constant glissandi and the high resolution microtonal nuances characteristic of seal songs can be performed by no other acoustic instruments as idiomatically. All the music performed by the string quartet derives from transcriptions of several bearded seal songs, which were generously provided to me by Joshua Jones, researcher at the Scripps Whale Acoustic Lab, University of California, San Diego. Variations of the transcriptions (mainly in pitch and duration) were based on statistics of the bearded seal repertoire from 2008-2009, included in the Jones et al. article: Ringed, Bearded, and Ribbon Seal Vocalizations North of Barrow, Alaska: Seasonal Presence and Relationship with Sea Ice.
