The album features Roscoe Mitchell on saxophones, Kikanju Baku on drums and Craig Taborn on piano and electronics. For this piece I was particularly interested in Roscoe’s polyphonic/multiphonic playing in the bass saxophone and the rhythmic complexity of Kikanju’s relentless rhythmic saturation. The arduous transcription process compensated with invaluable insight about this group’s improvisational and overall musical vocabularies. The orchestration aims to display the characteristic energy flow and development in Roscoe Mitchell’s masterful formal conception of improvisation. In this version, Roscoe Mitchell is improvising as a soloist. The original version does not include a solo improviser. I thank Maxwell Tfirn for developing a Max MSP patch that helped to transcribe the harmonic resonances created by the electronics in the middle section of the piece.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Splatter\nsubtitle: orchestral adaptation of a free improvisation by R.

Just as topography shows variations in altitude, the mind also fluctuates through different stages of activity in peaks and valleys. For this piece I took the visual content of a defined number of landscapes and translated it mainly to pitch, texture and density in the orchestral materials. The sections of this piece are based on a group of harmonic spectra that are used as foundations for other parameters in the piece. The creative process for this piece consisted on a thorough listening of the open fourth string of the double bass, its underlying harmonies (overtones), and their evolution in time. This piece is dedicated to my friend and first composition teacher, Ulises Ramírez.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Topographies\nsubtitle: (orchestra)\nduration: 14 min\nslug: topographies\nmp3: topographies.mp3\naiff: topografias\nimage: topographies.jpg\npdf: topographies.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Topographies\nyear: 2009\ncreation_date: 2009-10-01\ninstrumentation: Orchestra\nforces: 2.2.2\npremiere: September 30 , 2009\ncategory: Orchestra"},{"attributes":{"title":"Waves Break Aural Shores","subtitle":"portrait of Puerto Marqués","duration":"10 min","slug":"waves-break-aural-shores","mp3":"waves.mp3","image":"waves-pic.png","img_width":400,"pdf":"waves-score.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Waves Break Aural Shores (portrait of Puerto Marqués)","year":2018,"creation_date":"2018-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","instrumentation":"(saxophone quartet)","premiere":"February 2, 2018.

Waves Break Aural Shores was written using various spectral analyses of the sound of the ocean in Puerto Marqués, in the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Each analysis utilizes a specific resolution, register and loudness threshold, which result in different music notations and instrumental techniques. This leads to the notion of different versions of reality (waves) through the multiplicity and variability of perception (aural shores). Underlying the technique and theory behind the piece, my attempt is to translate the breath and pulse of the breaking waves, to reach inside the heart of another vastness. </p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Waves Break Aural Shores \nsubtitle: portrait of Puerto Marqués\nduration: 10 min\nslug: waves-break-aural-shores\nmp3: waves.mp3\nimage: waves-pic.png\nimg_width: 400\npdf: waves-score.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Waves Break Aural Shores (portrait of Puerto Marqués)\nyear: 2018\ncreation_date: 2018-02-06\ninstrumentation: (saxophone quartet)\npremiere: February 2, 2018.
