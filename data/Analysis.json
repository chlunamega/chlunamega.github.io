It is one of a multitude of works by Mâche that consist of, in his words, “an aesthetic project on the basis of a harmony with natural data”1. In Korwar, sounds of human speech (in Xhosa –a Niger-Congo language), birds, boars, whales, frogs, shrimp, guanacos, and rain, are the natural data from which the aesthetic idea of the piece is derived. Such human, animal and geological sounds are both featured as pre-recorded sounds in the piece and treated as sound models that are translated into motivic, textural and timbral material for the harpsichord. This analysis explores the relationships between the harpsichord and the pre-recorded sounds with regards to three main categories: 1. timbre (on a pitch to noise gradient), 2. synchrony, and 3. notation (on a determinate to indeterminate gradient). Conclusions regarding Form are extracted from the timbre-synchrony-notation analysis. In addition to the aforementioned comparative focus, the analysis also studies the harpsichord and tape parts independently, presenting Mâche’s various ideas of transcription, notation and instrumentation of pre-recorded natural and human sounds.</p>\n","frontmatter":"title: François-Bernard Mâche's \"Korwar\", notation implications of timbre in sound models \nslug: korwar\nimage: korwar-mache-image.png\nimg_width: 400\npdf: korwar-mache-analysis.pdf_DESCRIPTION_François-Bernard Mâche's \"Korwar\"\nyear: 2018\ncreation_date: 2018-04-15\ncategory: Analysis"},{"attributes":{"title":"Peter Ablinger's \"Quadraturen IV\", perception and reproduction of environmental sound through instrumental music","slug":"quadraturen-iv","image":"quadraturen-iv-image.png","img_width":350,"pdf":"quadratureniv-ablinger-analysis.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Peter Ablinger's \"Quadraturen IV\"","year":2017,"creation_date":"2017-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","category":null},"body":"<p>This paper focuses on Peter Ablinger&#39;s fascinating reflection on perception as a compositional building block in the fourth piece of cycle &quot;Quadraturen&quot;. The paper begins with an overview of the salient musical and conceptual features of Quadraturen IV. It then explores different connections of the piece as a translation of “reality” through music notation, orchestration and performance with theories of perception developed by biologist Humberto Maturana, cyberneticist Gregory Bateson and art critic Jonathan Crary. Lastly, as a reading of Bateson’s multiple versions of the world, Maturana’s ideas about perception in Autopoiesis and cognition, and Ablinger’s techniques used in Quadraturen IV, an alternate experimental idea of a spectral analysis and translation to music for performers is provided. This model is an example of a different approach to composition that would incorporate simultaneous modes of perception and instrumentations of the same environmental recording. </p>\n","frontmatter":"title: Peter Ablinger's \"Quadraturen IV\", perception and reproduction of environmental sound through instrumental music\nslug: quadraturen-iv\nimage: quadraturen-iv-image.png\nimg_width: 350\npdf: quadratureniv-ablinger-analysis.pdf_DESCRIPTION_Peter Ablinger's \"Quadraturen IV\"\nyear: 2017\ncreation_date: 2017-04-30\ncategory:"}]
