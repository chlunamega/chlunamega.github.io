The recordings were made with five simultaneous microphones in a pentagonal formation, at a distance of ~30 meters between each mic, at Walnut Creek Park. The installation recreates the forest&#39;s spatial distribution of it&#39;s sound masses by setting five speakers in the same order in which the microphones were originally placed. Each speaker projects the sound of its corresponding microphone. This creates an expanded listening field resulting from the different microphone responses and placings. By interacting with the space, the audience experiences various versions of the sonic reality. This video presents five fragments of the recording, each fragment featuring a specific microphone.
